# Zementis: Data Science Introduction Course


The repository contains the artifcats for the "Data Science Introduction" course which is part of the Zementis product training. 

This data science introduction course is the first part of the Zementis 2-days ramp-up training. The course introduces the data science process and common analytics terminology hands-on using R. Students will solve a real-world data science problem on their own. Their understanding of the entire process will lay the foundation for the subsequent parts of the training. 

## Prerequisites
